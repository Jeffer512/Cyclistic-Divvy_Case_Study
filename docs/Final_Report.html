<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>Established in 2016, Cyclistic is a bike-share offering service
located in Chicago, USA. Cyclistic currently offers more than 5,800
bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of over 690
stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to another station in the system anytime.</p>
<p>Cyclistic offers 3 pricing plans, single-ride passes, full-day passes
and annual memberships. Customer who purcharse single-ride passes or
full-day passes are referred to as casual users. Customers who purchase
annual membership are members</p>
<p>The Cyclistic team have recently concluded that annual memberships
are more profitable than casual riders. Furthermore, the team have noted
that while 30% of users use the bikes for their work commute, the
majority of Cyclistic users ride for leisure. This report will assess
how Cyclistic annual members and casual riders use bikes differently.
<br> <br></p>
</div>
<div id="process" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Process</h2>
<hr />
<p>Cyclistic releases data on a monthly basis in csv format, for the
purpose of this analysis data from October 2021 to September 2022 it’s
being used. Due to privacy issues there is no data related to the users
(like past purchases or location).</p>
<p>Each dataset contains between 100,000-830,000 rows. Due to the size
of the data R and RStudio were used to process and analyze it.</p>
<p>The datasets were imported to R and merged into one big dataframe
consisting of more than 5.8 million rows. Some columns were added to
allow aggregation by month, day, day of week, hour and ride length. The
data was then cleaned by removing negative ride lengths and ride lengths
below 60 seconds. All entries for docked bikes were also removed, since
this analysis is focused on differences between members and casual
users, and it seems members are treated as casual users when using
docked bikes. <br> <br></p>
</div>
<div id="analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Analysis</h2>
<hr />
<div id="number-of-rides-and-average-duration-by-month"
class="section level3">
<h3>3.1 Number of rides and average duration by month</h3>
<p><img src="Final_Report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="873.6" /></p>
<p><em>Note : Since the data used in this analysis represent just one
year, we can’t accurately look for yearly trends. This section of the
analysis is only valid as far as data from several previous years are
similar.</em></p>
<p>User rides are higher than casual rides in any month. The worst
months of the year for Cyclistic are January and February. The most
popular time of year are the summer months where the number of rides
reaches more than 15 times and more than 5 times the number of rides in
January for casual user and members respectively. This highlights
Cyclistic’s team findings that the most part of users ride for
leisure.</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of seasonality for both type of users but
still members use the service more consistently throughout the year.
Also, while casual rides went down on August, member rides continued
rising until September.</p>
</div>
<div id="number-of-rides-and-average-duration-by-day-of-week"
class="section level3">
<h3>3.2 Number of rides and average duration by day of week</h3>
<p><img src="Final_Report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="873.6" /></p>
<p>Members and casual users make 61% and 39% of the rides respectively.
The number of rides for members goes down on weekends (but its still
higher than for casual users), while the number of rides for casual goes
up a lot. That suggest that while members also use the service for
leisure, a lot of them use it mainly for their daily mobility needs like
commute to work. Casual users use it mostly for leisure.</p>
<p>The average ride duration is always higher for casual riders, this
also shows that casual riders are using the service for leisure much
more than members</p>
</div>
<div id="most-popular-time-of-day" class="section level3">
<h3>3.3 Most popular time of day</h3>
<p><img src="Final_Report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="873.6" /></p>
<p>Between Monday and Friday there are two spikes in the number of rides
for members, one at 07:00-08:00 where people go to work and a bigger one
between 16:00-18:00 (being at its highest at 17:00), where people get
out of work. That confirms that members use the service a lot for their
daily mobility needs. For casual users the number of rides is much lower
and it goes up slowly during the day, with its highest value at
17:00.</p>
<p>On weekends the number of rides per hour are pretty much the same for
members and casual users.</p>
<p>Looking at the average duration of rides by hour, the lowest value
for casual riders is higher than the highest value for members.</p>
</div>
<div id="number-of-rides-by-day" class="section level3">
<h3>3.4 Number of rides by day</h3>
<p><img src="Final_Report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="873.6" /></p>
<p>The number of rides for casual riders has a lot more variance, having
the highest and the lowest values in the year.</p>
<p>In general there are more member than casual rides, but there are
some days (mainly between May and August) where this is not the
case.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-of-different-types-of-bikes" class="section level3">
<h3>3.5 Use of different types of bikes</h3>
<p><img src="Final_Report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="873.6" /></p>
<p>Members use more classic bikes (52.8% of their rides) than electric
bikes. casual users use more electric bikes (57% of their rides) than
classic bikes.</p>
<p>The average duration of rides in electric bikes it’s 714 for members
and 1031 for casual riders. The average duration in classic bikes is 842
for members and 1756 for casual riders. This shows that, on average, the
time people spend on a ride increases when using classic bikes. What’s
interesting its that this increase in duration is much more pronounced
for casual riders with a 70% increase vs 18% for members.</p>
<p>This result in both type of riders having almost the same proportions
of their total ride time by bike type, despite casual users making less
rides in classic bikes.</p>

<p>Despite Cyclistic having stations covering a wide area of Chicago,
most popular stations are concentrated close to the shoreline.
Cyclistic’s most popular station is by far Streeter Dr &amp; Grand Ave
with 62237 rides, 65% more than the second most popular station. The
least popular stations are at the south and west, with a lot of stations
having less than 10 rides (Although it’s worth noting that a lot of
these stations seem to be relatively new, judging by the date of the
first ride recorded in the time period analyzed). This also reflects the
fact that most Cyclistic users ride for leisure. <br> <br></p>

<h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
<hr />
<div id="offer-a-discount-for-new-members" class="section level3">
<h3>4.1 Offer a discount for new members</h3>
<p>The most relevant difference on how members and casual riders use
Cyclistic bikes differently seems to be that members use it a lot for
their everyday life while casual riders don’t.</p>
<p>Offering a discount will encourage more people, mainly those who
already use Cyclistic, to buy an annual membership. If they end up using
the service for their daily activities like a lot of members do, then
they’re likely to keep paying for the subscription and if they don’t use
the service for their daily activities they will most likely use the
service less than the average for members, so they will not be less
profitable for Cyclistic than other members despite the discount.</p>
</div>
<div
id="a-marketing-campaign-highligthing-how-cyclistic-integrate-in-the-daily-life-of-chicag-locals"
class="section level3">
<h3>4.2 A marketing campaign highligthing how Cyclistic integrate in the
daily life of Chicag locals</h3>
<p>A marketing campaign highligthing on how Cyclistic is integrated in
the daily life of a lot of Chicago locals, showing what benefits they
get from it (e.g. skipping traffic, doing exercise, the convenience of
having stations in all the city, etc) and how others could also benefit
from integrating Cyclistic in their life over only using it sometimes
for leisure. Also highligthing how casual riders who already use the
service a lot can benefit in terms of price.</p>
</div>
<div id="gather-more-data-by-conducting-polls-on-customers"
class="section level3">
<h3>4.3 Gather more data by conducting polls on customers</h3>
<p>By conducting polls on customers Cyclistic could gain more insights
on what its customers think about Cyclistic, what do they like most
about it?, what, if anything,they don’t like?, how much they use the
service and for which purposes?, why don’t casual users buy a
membership?, what would make them more likely to become members?. For
instance maybe some users would buy a 6 month membership but not an
annual membership, Cyclistic financial team could analyze, taking
seasonality into account if that would be profitable at what price
should it be. Maybe some important amount of casual users are tourist
and Cyclistic wants to take that into account since they can’t convert
tourist to annual members.</p>
</div>
<div id="take-seasonality-into-account" class="section level3">
<h3>4.4 Take seasonality into account</h3>
<p>Analyze data from previous years to see if yearly trends found in the
analysis are consistent. That, with some other data could like the
number of tourist, could be used to make decisions, like doing most
marketing campaigns in the summer months where the number of casual
riders is much higher.</p>
